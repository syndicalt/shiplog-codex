# PR Timeline (Phase 5)

<!-- routing: tier-1, plan -->
<!-- cross-cutting: model-routing.md (Step 0), signing.md, closure-and-review.md, labels.md -->

0. **Routing check.** Run the phase entry check from `model-routing.md`.

1. **Pre-PR checks.** Follow `pr-workflow.md`. Direct `gh` usage is the default path in Codex. Helper PR skills may still be useful for extra validation, but **shiplog**'s internal PR workflow is authoritative for title, body, labels, and review-gate behavior.

2. **Create PR (Full Mode).** Use the PR timeline template below. Create the PR with `shiplog/history` and `shiplog/issue-driven` already applied. Sign per `signing.md`.

3. **Quiet Mode.** Create a clean feature PR with no **shiplog** content. Add a final summary comment to the `--log` PR using the quiet-mode template below. Sign per `signing.md`.

4. **Review gate.** Every PR requires cross-model review before merge. See `closure-and-review.md` for the review protocol, sign-off format, and merge authorization rules.

5. **Link and store.** PR body includes `Closes #<issue>` when the PR fully resolves the issue. For partial delivery, use `Addresses #<issue> (completes T1, T2, ...)` - see the partial-delivery template below and Section 1 of `closure-and-review.md`. Store key learning in the durable issue or PR history.

6. **Closure verification (optional).** When evidence-to-issue mapping is non-obvious, keep the verification local by default. Only delegate a bounded verifier if the user explicitly asked for sub-agents.

## Partial-Delivery PR Variant

When a PR ships some tasks but the issue has remaining work:

```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: history
issue: <ISSUE_NUMBER>
branch: issue/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<slug>
status: in-progress
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
-->

## Summary

[2-3 sentences: what this PR ships and why it is a partial delivery]

Addresses #<ISSUE_NUMBER> (completes T1, T2, T3)

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **T1:** [title] - [1-sentence summary of what shipped]
- [x] **T2:** [title] - [1-sentence summary]

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] **T4:** [title] - [why deferred: blocked on X / next phase / needs design]
- [ ] **T5:** [title] - [why deferred]

## Blocked On

- [External dependency with link, or "No external blockers - remaining tasks deferred by choice"]

## Journey Timeline

[Same structure as the standard PR template]

## Knowledge for Future Reference

[Same structure as the standard PR template]
