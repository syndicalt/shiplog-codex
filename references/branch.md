# Branch Setup (Phase 2)

<!-- routing: tier-2, plan then agent -->
<!-- cross-cutting: model-routing.md (Step 0), signing.md, labels.md, shell-portability.md -->

0. **Routing check.** Run the phase entry check from `model-routing.md`.

1. **Load context.** `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels,comments,milestone` and search the local knowledge graph. If the issue is missing obvious **shiplog** labels, backfill per `labels.md`.

2. **Create branch (worktree-first).** One branch, one worktree, one active implementation context.

   Prefer direct `git worktree` usage in Codex:
   ```bash
   DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name')
   git fetch origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH
   BRANCH=issue/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<brief-description>
   git worktree add ../$BRANCH -b $BRANCH origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH
   cd ../$BRANCH
   ```
   ```powershell
   $defaultBranch = gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
   git fetch origin $defaultBranch
   $branch = 'issue/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<brief-description>'
   git worktree add ../$branch -b $branch origin/$defaultBranch
   Set-Location ../$branch
   ```
   See `shell-portability.md` for shell-specific notes.
   **Fallback (in-place checkout):** Only when the user explicitly requests no worktree.

3. **Post timeline entry.** Full Mode: comment on the issue using the session-start template below. Quiet Mode: create `--log` branch and PR using the quiet-mode template below. Sign per `signing.md`.

4. **Load the plan** if it exists. In Codex, execute locally by default. Only hand work to a sub-agent when the user explicitly asked for delegation. Whether local or delegated, the plan should define a contract: allowed files, forbidden changes, stop conditions, verification, return artifact, and decision budget.

## Session-Start Comment (Full Mode)

```bash
gh issue comment <ISSUE_NUMBER> --body-file <temp-file>
```

Comment body:

```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: handoff
issue: <ISSUE_NUMBER>
phase: 2
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
-->

## [shiplog/session-start] <Brief description of the work>

**Branch:** `issue/<N>-<description>`
**Approach:** [1-2 sentences about the plan for this session]

---
Authored-by: <family>/<version> (<tool>)
*Captain's log - session start*
```

---

## Quiet Mode: `--log` Branch + PR

If the `--log` PR does not exist yet:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch>--log
git commit --allow-empty -m "shiplog: initialize knowledge log"
git push -u origin <branch>--log
gh pr create --base <branch> \
  --label "shiplog/worklog" \
  --label "shiplog/quiet-mode" \
  --label "shiplog/issue-driven" \
  --title "[shiplog/worklog] <description>" \
  --body-file <temp-file>
git checkout <branch>
```

PR body:
```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: state
issue: <ISSUE_NUMBER>
branch: <branch>--log
status: open
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
-->

## Knowledge Log

Tracking decisions and discoveries for this work.
```

If you deferred a brainstorm from plan capture, use that saved content as the initial PR body.

Then post a session-start comment on the `--log` PR:
```bash
gh pr comment <LOG_PR_NUMBER> --body-file <temp-file>
```

Comment body:
```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: handoff
issue: <ISSUE_NUMBER>
phase: 2
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
-->

## [shiplog/session-start] <Brief description of the work>

**Branch:** `<branch>--log`
**Approach:** [1-2 sentences about the plan for this session]

---
Authored-by: <family>/<version> (<tool>)
*Captain's log - session start*
```

Use the portable temp-file pattern from `shell-portability.md`.

## Delegation Handoff Comment

Use when delegating a bounded task to another agent or reviewer. In Codex, only do this when the user explicitly requested delegation.

```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: handoff
issue: <ID>
phase: <PHASE>
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
-->

## [#<ID>] delegation handoff: <task title>

**Delegated by:** <family>/<version> (<tool>)
**Target tier:** tier-3
**Why delegation fits:** [why this work is bounded and non-judgmental]

### Goal
[One concrete outcome.]

### Contract
- **Allowed files:** `path/to/file.ts`, `path/to/other.ts`
- **Must not change:** [files, APIs, behavior, or decisions outside scope]
- **Acceptance criteria:** [specific outcomes that define done]
- **Forbidden judgment calls:** [decisions the delegated agent must not make]
- **Stop and ask if:** [conditions that require escalation]
- **Active verification profile:** [profile names or `none`]
- **Verification required:** [tests, checks, or evidence required]
- **Return artifact:** [delegation report, changed-file list, verification note, blockers]
- **Decision budget:** `none` | `narrow`

### Task checklist
1. [Concrete action with file path]

### Gotchas
- [Anything the delegated agent could misunderstand]

Authored-by: <family>/<version> (<tool>)
```

## Delegation Return Artifact

```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: verification
issue: <ID>
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
-->

## [#<ID>] delegation report: <task title>

**Status:** completed | blocked | escalated
**Contract:** [link or quote the delegation handoff heading]

### Changed files
- `path/to/file.ts` - [summary]

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] [criterion met]
- [ ] [criterion not met, with reason]

### Verification status
- **Ran:** [commands/checks]
- **Passed:** [what passed]
- **Deferred:** [what was skipped, with reason]

### Decisions deferred upward
- [question or "None"]

### Blockers
- [blocker or "None"]

Authored-by: <family>/<version> (<tool>)
```

## Edge Cases

**Session resume:** Detect the issue from the current branch name or worktree. If the branch has an existing worktree, `cd` into it. Find linked PRs, read comments, then add a "session resumed" timeline comment via the timeline phase.

**Quiet Mode - feature branch rebased:** Rebase the `--log` branch onto the updated feature branch. Use `--force-with-lease`.
